# C# Tutorial â€“ Create a Simple Battle Ship Game in Visual Studio
Welcome to this new tutorial from MOO ICT. This one will be slightly different than the normal game programming tutorial we do in this channel. We are still making a game but we will be making the classic battle ship game that you can play against the CPU. 

This tutorial will show step by step how to make a full battle ship game where you are able select 3 different location where you will be placing your battle ships, enemy will choose 3 random positions to place its ships and then we select different locations to see if you hit first or does the enemy attack you first. 

Each player has 5 rounds to destroy 3 battle ships from side and its a fun game to make. We will be playing with lots of buttons in this tutorial, we work with timer, labels and combo box. There are lots of little programming tricks that will get you thinking about your own project in no time. 

Some of the core features I focused on this project is to make a game where you take a turn and the CPU will take a turn after you. Both players have equal chance to win. Check for win, lose and draw conditions and also to restart the game when the current game has ended. These are standard game development features but as you progress through with your own games always try to implement them when you can. 

I know its a long tutorial, but have fun with it. If you feel there are parts I can improve these videos let me know in the comments and as always happy programming and Moo Out.
